We will **learn to design and build an 4 channel LM35 temperature sensor chip Signal conditioner amplifier circuit** based on the popular opamp **LM324** using Kicad 6.0.The board can be used to monitor temperature from 4 different sources at the same time and can be used for building your own data acquisition system.

 - The board consists of **4 analog channels for connecting the outputs of the LM35 chip** and 4 output channels that gives the amplified output of the LM35 chip in the range of 0-5V, the **Gain of all 4 channels is around 3.7**.
- The board also has 4 amplified outputs that gives the amplified  voltage in the range from 0-3V ,making it easier to interface LM35 to 3V tolerant microcontrollers like MSP430,STM32
 - The board can also be used as a general purpose amplifier board that you can use to interface with other analog sensors and works with both  5V and 3.3 tolerant microcontrollers.
- The board is designed with **Kicad 6.0** and the video tutorial teaches you how to design a circuit board from schematics to PCB with KICAD 6.0 EDA.
- All the components used in the circuit are through hole components which helps the user to build the circuit in true DIY fashion and learn valuable soldering skills.
